{"name":"MqttShooter","tagline":"A fun way to get to grips with the Javascript MQTT client from the Eclipse Paho Project.","body":"### Lab Overview\r\nsome info here\r\n\r\n### Connection Details for MQTT\r\nThe lab host is running an instance of the IBM MessageSight for Developers Virtual Appliance, which you can use as the MQTT server during the session.\r\n\r\nThe connection details you need to configure, when prompted to do so in the lab instructions are:\r\n\r\nserver: 172.20.128.10\r\nport: 20004\r\n\r\n### Useful Information\r\nWhile developing the solution, you will likely want to refer to the documentation for the Paho JavaScript MQTT client.  This documentation can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eclipse.org/paho/files/jsdoc/symbols/Paho.MQTT.Client.html\r\n\r\nThe home page for the Paho JavaScript client also contains some helpful information, in the form of a minimal but functionally complete example of using the client library.  This can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/\r\n\r\nIf you wish to run your own MQTT server after the lab, check out IBM MessageSight Virtual Edition for Developers:\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.ibm.com/messaging/messagesight/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
